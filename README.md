# MacOS Initializer

This repository helps initialize bare-bone MacOS systems for developers. Very handy in order to quickly bring a laptop upto speed.

Either clone this repo or copy the shell script and simply run it using:

```
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

You have to babysit this script because it may require your password at times. The installation commands may also prompt you every now & then for a user input.
